title:  How topology shapes the vulnerability of complex supply networks
name: Dirk Witthaut 
talk-url: 
abstract: Structural failures and perturbations can impair the stable operation of supply networks such as power grids up to the point of complete collapse. But not all elements of a networks are equally vulnerable and not all nodes and links are equally affected. In this talk I discuss how the topology of a network shapes the response to damages and perturbations and how failures spread through the network. We focus on linear flow networks, which describe the operation of power grids or vascular networks to a good approximation. This approach enables deep insights into the interplay of flows, failures, and topology. We elucidate the role of distances and communities and introduce a method to inhibit failure spreading completely.
