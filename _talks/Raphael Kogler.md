abstract: The more and more pressing environmental concerns of recent years have propelled many advances concerning the stable operation of power grids with high penetration of renewable energy sources. Specifically, the idea of grid-forming inverters has gained great interest. While for the traditional synchronous machines there is a well established hierarchy of dynamical models with increasing degree of detail, the case of grid-forming inverters hosts yet a wide variety of different control concepts. This poses a significant challenge for modeling future power grids which we seek to address with this talk. By explicitly considering the rotational symmetry of a general AC power grid, we cast the system into a form that is suitable for a nonlinear approximation. This procedure reduces the description of the dynamics to a set of parameters that may be studied independently of concrete models, and provides a systematic way of adjusting model accuracy as well as complexity.
