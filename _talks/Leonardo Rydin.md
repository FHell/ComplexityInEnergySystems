title:  Spatio-temporal correlations in power-grid frequency recordings
name:  Leonardo Rydin 
talk-url: 
abstract: In this talk I will present a recent work focused on spatio-temporal correlations in power-grid frequency recordings (see Rydin Gorjão et al. [1]). In it, we have analysed an open database of measurements of electric power-grid frequencies across 17 locations in 12 synchronous areas on three continents (see Jumar et al. [2]). We show that the scaling law of fluctuations in power grids proposed in Schäfer et al. [3] is verified, with a small caveat particular to each power-grid control system and constraints. We study the dephasing of incremental correlations of power-grid frequency recordings, the puzzling decay of leptokurtic distribution of increments of power-grid frequency, and have a  first look at long-distance synchronisation across the Continental European grid. In this talk I will bring forth the proposal to examine power-grid frequency recordings in the ambit of stochastic process, to make use of the more common stochastic analysis and estimators available, the parallel to other dynamical systems, and open question in this ambit.
