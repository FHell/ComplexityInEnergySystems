abstract: In this talk we suggest modeling the dynamics of power grids in terms of a two-layer network, and we use the Italian high-voltage power grid as a proof-of-principle example. The first layer in our model represents the power grid consisting of generators and consumers, while the second layer represents a dynamic communication network that serves as a controller of the first layer. In particular, the dynamics of the power grid is modeled by the Kuramoto model with inertia, while the communication layer provides a control signal P_{i}^{c} for each generator to improve frequency synchronization within the power grid. We propose different realizations of the communication layer topology and different ways to calculate the control signal. Then we conduct a systematic survey of the two-layer system against a multitude of different realistic perturbation scenarios, such as disconnecting generators, increasing demand of consumers, or generators with stochastic power output. When using a control topology that allows all generators to exchange information, we find that a control scheme aimed to minimize the frequency difference between adjacent nodes operates very efficiently even against the worst scenarios with the strongest perturbations.
