title:  Model predictive control framework for congestion management with large batteries in subtransmission grid.
name: Jean Maeght (RTE, France)
talk-url: 
abstract: RTE will build and put into operation 3 large battery storage systems in 2021 (10MW/20MWh). These batteries, together with intermittent renewable generation curtailment and line switching, will be used to manage congestions in 3 small subtransmission zones (63kV or 90kV). A local controller will send orders to the battery, to power plants and switches every 5 seconds, using all the flexibility offered by permanent and emergency ratings. This local controller will not have any forecast and will not be able to manage preventive actions, so a higher level scheduler will be in charge of security analysis (N-1 analysis), battery preventive actions, pre-discharging the battery for forthcoming congestions. Moreover, this higher level scheduler will be in charge of computation of capacity tunnels; these capacity tunnels will to share the use of the batteries with other services when there are no congestions.

**Bio:**
Jean Maeght received the M.S. degree in mathematics in 1997 from both Orsay (now Paris Saclay) and Toulouse Universities, France. In 2000, he received the Ph.D. degree in mathematical optimization applied to medical imaging from Toulouse University. He has been with Artelys French company for 8 years, as a Consultant specializing in applications of optimization to various industrial and economic fields. In 2008 he joined the French Transmission System Operator RTE (Reseau de Transport dâ€™Electricite) in the R&D Department

He is focusing on optimization methods for power systems: coordination, optimal power flow, operational planning, grid development, economical studies. Jean has been involved in many European Research Projects (Twenties, iTesla, e-Highway2050, Osmose, POEMA) and bilateral cooperation projects with academic labs. As in France PhD students may work on their PhD directly in companies, Jean has been supervising several PhD students within RTE, on Global Optimality for OPF and on Battery Management algorithms.
