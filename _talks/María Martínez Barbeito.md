title:  Frequency fluctuations and stability of power grids with a large renewables penetration ratio

abstract: The integration of a high ratio of renewable energy sources in the power system is not a trivial task. In particular, their intermittent and unpredictable nature may lead to unwanted frequency fluctuations. We propose a model that includes both renewable and conventional generation and demand variations, which allows for the study of many different energy transition scenarios. We model the power grid as a network of substations and power plants (nodes) interconnected via power transmission lines (links). We focus our analysis on islands, which typically have on one side a high dependence on fossil fuels, and on the other a high renewable energy potential. More precisely, we analyze the cases of Gran Canaria and the Balearic Islands (Spain).
