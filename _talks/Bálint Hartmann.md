abstract: Since the introduction of small-world and scale-free properties, there is ongoing discussion on how certain real-world networks fit into these network science concepts. While the electrical power grid was among the most discussed example of these real-word networks, published results are controversial and usually missed to take the aspects of network evolution into consideration. As a result of this, there is a broad agreement that power grids are small-world networks and might show scale-free behaviour, although very little attempts were made to find how these characteristics of the network are related to grid infrastructure development or other underlying phenomena. In this paper the authors use the 70-year historical dataset of the Hungarian power grid to perform network analysis, which is the first attempt to evaluate small-world and scale-free properties on long-term real-world data. Results of the analysis suggest that power grids show small-world behaviour only after the introduction of multiple voltage levels. It is also demonstrated that the node distribution of the examined power grid does not show scale-free behaviour and that the scaling is stabilised around certain values after the initial phase of grid evolution.
