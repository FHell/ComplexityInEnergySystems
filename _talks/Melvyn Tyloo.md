title:  The Key Player Problem in High-Voltage Power Networks.
name:  Melvyn Tyloo 
talk-url: 
abstract: Identifying key players in coupled individual systems is a fundamental problem in network theory. We investigate synchronizable network-coupled dynamical systems such as high-voltage electric power networks and coupled oscillators on complex networks. We define key players as nodes that, once perturbed, generate the largest excursion away from synchrony. A spectral decomposition of the coupling matrix gives an elegant solution to this identification problem. We show that, when the coupling matrix is Laplacian, key players are peripheral in the sense of a centrality measure and global network indices defined from effective resistance distances. The resistance distances can then be used to establish rankings of the nodes according to their impact on the overall synchronous state when they are perturbed.
