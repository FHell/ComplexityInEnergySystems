    <h2 class="p-name" itemprop="name">by Mehrnaz Anvari</h2>
  </header>Abstract: <br> Modern societies highly depend on electricity supply via power grids. Without electricity, people do not have access to food, transportation, medical treatment and so on. Moreover, in an extended outage the security of a community can be in danger. Therefore, stability of the power grid has highest priority. For that, the balance between the energy consumption and the required energy should be provided. Recently, the ongoing energy transition towards renewable generation fundamentally changes the conditions for the operation of the power system. The new sources of energy, such as wind and solar energy, unlike traditional ones are highly variable and are known as sources of fluctuations. These fluctuations, as well as fluctuations caused by demand and energy trading market, can affect the stability of the power grid, leading to the frequent outages or even extended blackout in the system. Therefore, considering these fluctuations and their effect on the power grid give deeper insights for the optimization design of future power grids as well as control schemes. This circumstance holds especially in distributed power grids, where the role of these fluctuations becomes more important because of the smaller size of the grid. In previous works, the footprint of these fluctuations on power grid frequency variations has been demonstrated. Moreover, perturbing a single node in a power grid with different types of fluctuations and considering the response of the network to these fluctuations via linear response theory has been discussed in several papers. In our new work, unlike the previous ones, we investigate the effect of spatially correlated fluctuations in different network topologies, specifically power grids. Therefore, we demonstrate the constructive and destructive effects of these types of fluctuations in networks.</a> <br><br>Further Notes:
